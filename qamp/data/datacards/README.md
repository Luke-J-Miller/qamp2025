# Dataset Cards â€” Guidance

- Fill every field in TEMPLATE.md; avoid TBDs.
- List exact attribute names in nodes.parquet and edges.parquet.
- Document split policy and fixed seed(s).
- Include license and source URL for external datasets.
- Note caveats: imbalance, missing attributes, duplicates, directionality.
